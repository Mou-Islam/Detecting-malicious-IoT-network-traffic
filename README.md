# Detecting-malicious-IoT-network-traffic
Here we predicted the incoming network traffic on IoT( Internet of Things) environments in malicious or not.
We analyzed the network traffic in IoT systems will be classified as benign or malicious(harmful).
Using Support Vector Machines(SVM), an efficient and effective intrusion detection system can be created to
safeguard IoT networks asthis will detect incoming harmful network traffic and prevent it.
